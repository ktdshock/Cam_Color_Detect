# Cam_Color_Detect

A real-time Python project that uses your webcam and OpenCV to detect multiple colors (red, green, blue, yellow, and purple). The program draws bounding boxes, labels, and center points around detected objects based on their color.

## 📸 Features

- Real-time webcam feed with OpenCV
- Detects multiple colors using HSV color space
- Draws bounding boxes and labels around detected objects
- Can be expanded for custom color tracking or object detection (YOLO, Haar, etc.)

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
